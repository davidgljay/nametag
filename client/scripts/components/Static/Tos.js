    <h1>Nametag Terms of Service</h1>
    <h3>1. Your Acceptance</h3>
    <div>By using or visiting the Nametag website or any Nametag products, software, data feeds, and services provided to you on, from, or through the Nametag website (collectively the "Service") you signify your agreement to these terms and conditions (the "Terms of Service").  If you do not agree to any of these terms, then please do not use the Service.</div>
    <div>Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these Terms of Service, you should periodically review the most up-to-date version which is posted at  http:/nametag.chat.  Nametag may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise these Terms of Service and other policies at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions.  Nothing in these Terms of Service shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.</div>
    <h3>2. Service</h3>
    <div>These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Service, including users who are also contributors of Content on the Service.  “Content” includes the text, software, scripts, media, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, interactive features, and other materials you may view on, access through, or contribute to the Service.  The Service includes all aspects of Nametag, including but not limited to all products, software, applications, and/or services offered via the Nametag website, if any.</div>
    <div>The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by Nametag.  Nametag has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, Nametag will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site.  By using the Service, you expressly relieve Nametag from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.</div>
    <div>Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you visit.</div>
    <h3>3. Third Party Accounts</h3>
    <div>In order to access some features of the Service, you will have to create a Facebook or Google Account.  You may never use another{'\''}s account without permission.  When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information.  You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. </div>
    <div>Although Nametag will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of Nametag or others due to such unauthorized use.</div>
    <h3>4. General Use of the Service—Permissions and Restrictions</h3>
    <div>Nametag hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:</div>
    <ul>
      <li>You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Service or the Content without Nametag{'\''}s prior written authorization, unless Nametag makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the Service.</li>
      <li>You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Service.</li>
      <li>You agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the pages of the Service itself or other explicitly authorized means Nametag may designate.</li>
      <li>You agree not to use the Service for any of the following commercial uses unless you obtain Nametag{'\''}s prior written approval:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A)  the sale of access to the Service;</li>
        <li>B)  the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Service or Content; or</li>
        <li>C) the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content delivered via the Service, unless other material not obtained from Nametag appears on the same page and is of sufficient value to be the basis for such sales.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Prohibited commercial uses do not include any use that Nametag expressly authorizes in writing.</li>
      <li>You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Nametag servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Nametag may grant the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials.  Nametag reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generically or in specific cases.  You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service (e.g., comments, email) for any commercial solicitation purposes.  You agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of the Service with respect to their Content.</li>
      <li>In your use of the Service, you will comply with all applicable laws.</li>

Nametag may at any time, without prior notice and in its sole discretion, remove such Content and/or terminate a user{'\''}s account for submitting such material in violation of these Terms of Service.</div>
    <div>Notwithstanding any other statement in these Terms of Service, you agree that Nametag has sole and absolute discretion to terminate your access to the Service at any time, for any reason, without consequence to Nametag.</div>

    <h3>13. General</h3>
    <div>You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in the State of California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Nametag, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California.  These Terms of Service shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.  Any claim or dispute between you and Nametag that arises in whole or in part from the Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in San Francisco County, California.  These Terms of Service, together with any other legal notices published by Nametag on the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Nametag concerning the Service.  If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect.  No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Nametag's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.  Nametag reserves the right to amend these Terms of Service at any time and without notice, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service for any changes.  Your use of the Service following any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms.  YOU AND NAMETAG AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</div>
